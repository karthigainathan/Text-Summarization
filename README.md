# Text-Summarization LDA, LSA, LEXRANK


Abstract

Background: In todayâ€™s computerized world enormous amount of unstructured textual data is
generated across the internet every day. There is a need for algorithms to extract the knowledge from
these texts in a more reliable method. Automatic text summarization is one of the flourishing areas in
the text mining domain that is defined as the condensing of large documents without losing the essential
content from the original text.


Objectives: Automatic summarization is of two types, abstractive and extractive and this research work
emphases on extractive text summarization. Extractive summarization involves extracting the most
critical sentence based on feature selection to form the summary. The experimental data chosen is the
summarization of the Brexit news articles for 45 days. The inspiration to do on Brexit news articles was
it is one of the hottest topics, and an enormous amount of news gathered every day. Moreover,
condensing news articles will significantly increase the number of readers and consumes less time while
reading the condensed article without losing the main ideas. The implementation is done using Latent
Dirichlet Allocation, Latent Semantic Analysis, Sentence Rank, and Text Rank.


Results: The evaluation of the model is done using Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation
(ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2). Next, each model summary is further examined with a human-generated


summary.
Findings: Regarding finding the performance of summary between models, the precision value of
Sentence Rank summary for Rouge-1 (0.444353516) and Rouge-2 (0.332641116) performed better
compared to other models. However, the model underperformed regarding precision, and future work
is addressed for improving the efficiency of the model.
